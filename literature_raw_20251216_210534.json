      "content": "The overall proportion of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to NAFLD was 15•1% (95% CI 11•9-18•9). The proportion of patients with NAFLDrelated hepatocellular carcinoma was highest in the South-East Asia region, followed by the Western Pacific region, European region, and the region of the Americas (figure 2 ; appendix p 10-11). There was an increase in the global proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to NAFLD over time periods (9•77%, 95% CI Overall survival did not differ between NAFLD-related versus non-NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 1•05, 95% CI 0•92-1•20; p=0•43; table 2 ). Subgroup analyses also did not differ for overall survival between NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to HBV, HCV, or alcohol (appendix pp 19-20). However, among patients with cirrhosis (sensitivity analysis), NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with increased mortality (p=0•0041) compared with hepatocellular carcinoma due to other causes (1•74, 1•21-2•67; p=0•0041). A sensitivity analysis of patients who underwent curative therapy established that NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with longer overall survival than HCV-related hepato cellular carcinoma for patients receiving curative treatment (p=0•041; appendix p 20), but not when compared with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (p=0•78; appendix p 20) or all other causes combined (p=0•94; table 2 ). For the sensitivity analysis for type of curative treatment, overall survival did not differ between NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma compared with other causes in patients receiving liver transplant (p=0•13) or resection (p=0•58; table 2 ). Metaregression of study level data did not reveal any studylevel factors to be associated with overall survival among patients with NAFLD-related hepato cellular carcinoma (appendix p 18). NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma had improved disease-free survival compared with non-NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 0•79, 95% CI 0•63-0•99; p=0•044; table 2 ), although subgroup analysis by specific causes (HBV, HCV, and alcohol) did not differ (appendix p 20). Disease-free survival among patients with cirrhosis was not analysed due to insufficient data. In a sensitivity analysis, NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with improved disease-free survival among patients who received curative therapy (p=0•0011). In sensitivity analysis for specific types of curative treatment, NALFD-related hepatocellular carcinoma was also associated with improved disease-free survival in patients who underwent liver resection (p=0•0043; table 2), but not for liver transplantation (p=0 •12). Meta-regression of study-level data revealed that only increased alpha fetoprotein was associated with reduced disease-free survival, all other assessed risk factors were not associated with disease-free survival (p=0•029; appendix p 18).",

      "content": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare and contrast the expression of all  members of the Kallikrein (KLK) family of genes across 15 cancer types and to  evaluate their utility as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. RESULTS: Severe  alterations were found in the expression of different Kallikrein genes across  various cancers. Interestingly, renal clear cell and papillary carcinomas have  similar kallikrein expression profiles, whereas, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma  has a unique expression profile. Several KLK genes have excellent biomarker  potential (AUC > 0.90) for chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (KLK2, KLK3, KLK4,  KLK7, KLK15), renal papillary carcinoma (KLK1, KLK6, KLK7), clear cell renal cell  carcinoma (KLK1, KLK6), thyroid carcinoma (KLK2, KLK4, KLK13, KLK15) and colon  adenocarcinoma (KLK6, KLK7, KLK8, KLK10). Several KLK genes were significantly  associated with mortality in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (KLK2: HR = 1.69;  KLK4: HR = 1.63; KLK8: HR = 1.71; KLK10: HR = 2.12; KLK11: HR = 1.76; KLK14: HR =  1.86), papillary renal cell carcinoma (KLK6: HR = 3.38, KLK7: HR = 2.50),  urothelial bladder carcinoma (KLK5: HR = 1.89, KLK6: HR = 1.71, KLK8: HR = 1.60),  and hepatocellular carcinoma (KLK13: HR = 1.75). METHODS: The RNA-seq gene  expression data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Statistical  analyses, including differential expression analysis, receiver operating  characteristic curves and survival analysis (Cox proportional-hazards regression  models) were performed. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive analysis revealed the  changes in the expression of different KLK genes associated with specific cancers  and highlighted their potential as a diagnostic and prognostic tool.",

      "content": "In this study, we elucidated the pivotal role of KSR1 in hepatic carcinogenesis and explored its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer. Our findings demonstrate that KSR1 overexpression is a common feature in HCC and is significantly correlated with activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In subsequent studies, we found that KSR1 overexpression induced MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, demonstrating its causative role in activating the signaling pathway. This observation suggests that KSR1 overexpression serves as a major driver for the pathway activation in HCC which rarely harbors mutations in RAS and RAF. Although the precise molecular mechanism by which overexpression of KSR1 enhances MEK1/2 phosphorylation was not fully delineated in this study, previous reports indicate that KSR1 forms complexes with MEK and can allosterically transactivate BRAF, thereby enhancing its kinase activity toward MEK1/2 [34, 49] . Thus, it is plausible that KSR1 overexpression promotes MEK-KSR1 complex formation, leading to more efficient BRAFmediated phosphorylation of MEK1/2.",

      "content": "To gain insights into the mechanisms by which MAP9 functioned as a tumour suppressor in HCC, we applied a gene expression profiling assay in liver tissues from MAP9 knockout and WT mice. We identified that NER pathway as one of the critical pathways was involved in MAP9 functional regulation in liver. NER, the most flexible of the DNA repair pathways in response to the multiformity of DNA lesions, executes the excision of the damaged DNA fragment and synthesis of a new DNA strand portion [20] . Deregulation of NER signalling has been reported in a variety of malignancies [21] [22] [23] [24] . Here we demonstrated that NER signalling was involved in the liver pathogenesis in MAP9 knockout mice. We further revealed that ERCC3 was a core-enriched gene in NER pathway regulated by MAP9 in HCCs. Enhanced ERCC3/XPB expression was demonstrated in liver tissues of MAP9 Δ/Δ mice. We discovered that ERCC3 harboured an increased expression, depicted a negative correlation with MAP9 expression and acted as an independent prognostic factor of poor survival in HCC patients. Besides, appreciable decrease in ERCC3/XPB expression or nuclear aggregation was caused by MAP9, but a substantial increase was shown in liver tumours in MAP9 Δ/Δhep mice. Re-expression of ERCC3 promoted cell growth and invasion, and abrogated the tumour suppressive effects of MAP9. These data collectively indicated that ERCC3 was required for MAP9 deficiency induced HCC. As a core gene in NER pathway, ERCC3 may influences the aggressive phenotype of liver cancer cells through DNA damage. We have recently reported that MAP9 acted as a microtubule stabilizer and MAP9 loss caused chromosomal instability especially in MAP9 À/À p53 +/À mice [25] . Others have reported that MAP9 directly interacts with and stabilizes p53 [12] , which could regulate NER pathway and contribute to DNA repair [26] . A direct interaction of p53 with ERCC3 was demonstrated in hepatitis C virus infection [27] . Therefore, MAP9 may regulate ERCC3 in NER pathway through upregulating p53. Further studies need to be conducted to confirm the exact mechanistic interplay of MAP9 on ERCC3 regulation. In conclusion, we identified for the first time that MAP9 is a novel tumour suppressor gene in HCC. MAP9 exerts a tumour suppressive function by downregulating ERCC3/XPB expression and serves as an independent prognostic factor in HCC patients.",

      "content": "Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) gene mutation is common in colorectal cancer  (CRC) and is often predictive of treatment failure and poor prognosis. To  understand the mechanism, we compared the transcriptome of CRC patients with  wild-type and mutant KRAS and found that KRAS mutation is associated with the  overexpression of a secreted serine protease, kallikrein-related peptidase 10  (KLK10). Moreover, using in vitro and in vivo models, we found that KLK10  overexpression favors the rapid growth and liver metastasis of KRAS mutant  CRC and can also impair the efficacy of KRAS inhibitors, leading to drug  resistance and poor survival. Further functional assays revealed that the  oncogenic role of KLK10 is mediated by protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1).  KLK10 cleaves and activates PAR1, which further activates  3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)-AKT oncogenic pathway. Notably,  suppressing PAR1-PDK1-AKT cascade via KLK10 knockdown can effectively inhibit CRC  progression and improve the sensitivity to KRAS inhibitor, providing a promising  therapeutic strategy. Taken together, our study showed that KLK10 promotes the  progression of KRAS mutant CRC via activating PAR1-PDK1-AKT signaling pathway.  These findings expanded our knowledge of CRC development, especially in the  setting of KRAS mutation, and also provided novel targets for clinical  intervention.",

The genes from the 11 signatures consisted of a scale-free functional PPI network. The protein expression levels of the core nodes, RAD21, CDK1, and HDAC2, had prognostic value for HCC patients; however, only CDK1 was an independent prognostic factor. Further, because inhibition of CDK1 showed promising anticancer activity, it could serve as a therapeutic target for HCCs. In summary, the results provide potential biomarkers for the prediction of prognosis and present potential targets for the treatment of HCC patients.

Furthermore, ELMO1 is inversely correlated with TMB by regulating MMR or DDR. In addition, ELMO1 links EMT with TMB. Close monitoring of ELMO1 levels in patients has the potential to predict the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in HCC either alone or combined with TMB.

      "content": "Background The majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following hepatic resection experience tumor recurrence. Statin use is associated with a reduced risk of HCC development; however, the association between statin use and the prognosis of HCC after resection remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the effect of statin use on the prognosis after hepatic resection among patients with HCC.\nMethods A nationwide cohort study was performed with data from the National Health Insurance Service Database in Korea. Among 65,101 HCC patients who underwent hepatic resection between January 2002 and December 2017, we included 21,470 patients. For validation, a hospital-based cohort of 3366 patients with very early or early-stage HCC who received curative-intent hepatic resection between January 2010 and December 2018 was analyzed. Recurrencefree survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was compared between statin users and non-users. Findings Among the nationwide cohort of 21,470 patients, 2399 (11.2%) used statins and 19,071 (88.8%) did not. Among the hospital cohort of 3366 patients, 363 (10.8%) used statins and 3003 (89.2%) did not. In the propensity score-matched nationwide cohort, statin users had better RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.64; P < 0.001) and OS (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.45-0.53; P < 0.001), with a duration-response relationship. In the propensity score-matched validation hospital cohort, statin treatment was significantly associated with better RFS (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.90; P = 0.003) and OS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32-0.72; P < 0.001). The beneficial effects of statins were more prominent in non-cirrhotics, tumors sized ≥3 cm, tumors with microscopic vascular invasion, or early HCC recurrence (<2 years after resection).\nInterpretation Statin use was associated with a better prognosis in a population-based cohort of patients with HCC after hepatic resection, which was further validated in a large hospital-based cohort.\nFunding Asan Institute for Life Sciences and Corporate Relations; Korean Association for the Study of the Liver.",

As previously reported, patients with \"hot\" tumors of the Immune class [25] and the C3 subtype [22] exhibited better survival. We most recently addressed that fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) was overexpressed in intratumoral hepatic stellate cells of metabolic disease-associated HCC, and that FABP4 contributed to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines through NF-κB nuclear translocation, resulting in the recruitment of macrophages [28] . M2 Macrophages are attractive targets for cancer treatment [35] , and pexidartinib, an inhibitor of the CSF1/CSF1-R signaling which plays essential roles in proliferation and differentiation of M2 macrophages, may improve the prognosis of patients with the MS3 subtype. Shalapour et al. have recently reported that the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling contributes to liver carcinogenesis in individuals with NASH [36] . These results are consistent with the immune profiles of the MS3 subtype (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4 ), and then imply that PD-1 blockade may inhibit the MS3 HCC growth and development. Since anti-CSF1R and anti-PD-1 antibodies can synergistically attenuate BRAF V600E -driven melanoma cells in mice [37] , the combination is also a promising therapy for the MS3 subtype.",

Fujita et al. identifies tumor-specific immunosuppressive mechanisms which could be targeted to improve efficacy of treatments, including innovative strategies combining immune-modulatory agents and anti-tumor compounds. Several studies have already demonstrated the potential benefit of such combined therapies. Thus, co-treatments with PD-1 inhibitors and kinase inhibitors (e.g. lenvatinib, sunitinib) improve anti-tumor responses and tumor regression. Combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors that have shown great results in melanoma are also currently tested in HCC. Similarly, the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitors (e.g. avelumab) are being evaluated with sorafenib or axitinib in patients with advanced HCC. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, exhibits immunomodulatory although the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear [6] . In immunodeficient mice, sorafenib enhances the efficacy of human CAR-T cells against HCC [7] . These results suggest that combining immunotherapy and drugs presenting immunomodulatory effects represents a promising effective therapeutic strategy in HCC. Thus, efficient immunotherapy in HCC will need both a clear comprehension of immunosuppressive mechanisms and the development of effective drug combination. In this context, molecules or pathways involved in immunosuppression and cancer progression represent ideal targets. Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFb) is such a relevant target, inducing tumor microenvironment remodeling and exhibiting potent immunosuppressive features.

The  researchers employed various feature selection techniques to identify the key  predictors of patient mortality. Additionally, the study utilized a range of  machine learning methods to model patient survival rates. The study included 393  individuals with HCC. For early-stage patients (stages 1-2), the models reached  recall values ​​of up to 91% for 6-month survival prediction. For advanced-stage  patients (stage 4), the models achieved accuracy values ​​of up to 92% for 3-year  overall survival prediction. To predict whether patients are ex or not, the  accuracy was 87.5% when using all 28 features without feature selection with the  best performance coming from the implementation of weighted KNN. Further  improvements in accuracy, reaching 87.8%, were achieved by applying feature  selection methods and using a medium Gaussian SVM. This study demonstrates that  machine learning techniques can reliably predict survival probabilities for HCC  patients across all disease stages. The research also shows that AI models can  accurately identify a high proportion of surviving individuals when assessing  various clinical and pathological factors.",

      "content": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of  cancer-related deaths worldwide, but there is a deficiency of early diagnosis  biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Drug resistance accounts for most HCC-related  deaths, yet the mechanisms underlying drug resistance remain poorly understood.  METHODS: Expression of Frizzled-10 (FZD10) in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) was  identified by means of RNA sequencing and validated by means of real-time  polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. In vitro and in vivo  experiments were used to assess the effect of FZD10 on liver CSC expansion and  lenvatinib resistance. RNA sequencing, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation,  and luciferase report assays were applied to explore the mechanism underlying  FZD10-mediated liver CSCs expansion and lenvatinib resistance. RESULTS:  Activation of FZD10 in liver CSCs was mediated by METTL3-dependent  N6-methyladenosine methylation of FZD10 messenger RNA. Functional studies  revealed that FZD10 promotes self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and metastasis of  liver CSCs via activating beta-catenin and YAP1. The FZD10-beta-catenin/YAP1 axis is  activated in liver CSCs and predicts poor prognosis. Moreover,  FZD10-beta-catenin/c-Jun axis transcriptionally activates METTL3 expression, forming  a positive feedback loop. Importantly, the FZD10/beta-catenin/c-Jun/MEK/ERK axis  determines the responses of hepatoma cells to lenvatinib treatment. Analysis of  patient cohort, patient-derived tumor organoids, and patient-derived xenografts  further suggest that FZD10 might predict lenvatinib clinical benefit in patients  with HCC. Furthermore, treatment of lenvatinib-resistant HCC with  adeno-associated virus targeting FZD10 or a beta-catenin inhibitor restored  lenvatinib response. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated FZD10 expression promotes expansion of  liver CSCs and lenvatinib resistance, indicating that FZD10 expression is a novel  prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for human HCC.",

We showed that silencing of CDC34 inhibited cell proliferation and colony forming activity of NSCLC cells in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3 ), and suppressed tumor growth and prolonged lifespan of xenograft NSCLC mouse models in vivo (Fig. 4 ). In an EGFR L858R -driven mouse lung adenocarcinoma model, shCDC34 treatment significantly inhibited cancer progression and prolonged survival time of the mice (Fig. 8 ). These results indicate that CDC34 represents a rational drug target for NSCLC. Moreover, treatment of the patients with gefitinib and erlotinib will fail because of the development of EGFR T790M mutation [60] , which affects the gatekeeper residue in the kinase catalytic domain and weakens the interaction of the inhibitors with the target [61] . Efforts have been made to overcome drug resistance [62, 63] .

Here, we identify  CD49f as a prominent marker for discerning TICs in hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC), outperforming other commonly used TIC markers. CD49f-high TICs  specifically recruit tumor-promoting neutrophils via the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis and  create an immunosuppressive milieu in the tumor microenvironment (TME).  Reciprocally, the neutrophils reprogram nearby tumor cells toward a TIC phenotype  via secreting CCL4. These cells can evade CD8(+) T cell-mediated killing through  CCL4/STAT3-induced and CD49f-stabilized CD155 expression. Notably, while aberrant  CD155 expression contributes to immune suppression, it also represents a  TIC-specific vulnerability. We demonstrate that either CD155 deletion or antibody  blockade significantly enhances sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy in preclinical  HCC models. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of tumor immune evasion and  provide a rationale for combining CD155 blockade with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in  HCC.",

Herein, we systematically assessed the prognostic effects of these gene signatures and identified valuable prognostic biomarkers by integrating these gene signatures. With two independent HCC datasets (GSE14520, N = 242 and GSE54236, N = 78), 30 published gene signatures were evaluated, and 11 were significantly associated with the overall survival (OS) of postoperative HCC patients in both datasets. The random survival forest models suggested that the gene signatures were superior to clinical characteristics for predicting the prognosis of the patients. Based on the 11 gene signatures, a functional protein-protein interaction (PPI) network with 1406 nodes and 10,135 edges was established. With tissue microarrays of HCC patients (N = 60), we determined the prognostic values of the core genes in the network and found that RAD21, CDK1, and HDAC2 expression levels were negatively associated with OS for HCC patients. The multivariate Cox regression analyses suggested that CDK1 was an independent prognostic factor, which was validated in an independent case cohort (N = 78). In cellular models, inhibition of CDK1 by siRNA or a specific inhibitor, RO-3306, reduced cellular proliferation and viability for HCC cells. These results suggest that the prognostic predictive capacities of these gene signatures are reproducible and that CDK1 is a potential prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target for HCC patients.",

      "content": "To gain insights into the mechanisms by which MAP9 functioned as a tumour suppressor in HCC, we applied a gene expression profiling assay in liver tissues from MAP9 knockout and WT mice. We identified that NER pathway as one of the critical pathways was involved in MAP9 functional regulation in liver. NER, the most flexible of the DNA repair pathways in response to the multiformity of DNA lesions, executes the excision of the damaged DNA fragment and synthesis of a new DNA strand portion [20] . Deregulation of NER signalling has been reported in a variety of malignancies [21] [22] [23] [24] . Here we demonstrated that NER signalling was involved in the liver pathogenesis in MAP9 knockout mice. We further revealed that ERCC3 was a core-enriched gene in NER pathway regulated by MAP9 in HCCs. Enhanced ERCC3/XPB expression was demonstrated in liver tissues of MAP9 Δ/Δ mice. We discovered that ERCC3 harboured an increased expression, depicted a negative correlation with MAP9 expression and acted as an independent prognostic factor of poor survival in HCC patients. Besides, appreciable decrease in ERCC3/XPB expression or nuclear aggregation was caused by MAP9, but a substantial increase was shown in liver tumours in MAP9 Δ/Δhep mice. Re-expression of ERCC3 promoted cell growth and invasion, and abrogated the tumour suppressive effects of MAP9. These data collectively indicated that ERCC3 was required for MAP9 deficiency induced HCC. As a core gene in NER pathway, ERCC3 may influences the aggressive phenotype of liver cancer cells through DNA damage. We have recently reported that MAP9 acted as a microtubule stabilizer and MAP9 loss caused chromosomal instability especially in MAP9 À/À p53 +/À mice [25] . Others have reported that MAP9 directly interacts with and stabilizes p53 [12] , which could regulate NER pathway and contribute to DNA repair [26] . A direct interaction of p53 with ERCC3 was demonstrated in hepatitis C virus infection [27] . Therefore, MAP9 may regulate ERCC3 in NER pathway through upregulating p53. Further studies need to be conducted to confirm the exact mechanistic interplay of MAP9 on ERCC3 regulation. In conclusion, we identified for the first time that MAP9 is a novel tumour suppressor gene in HCC. MAP9 exerts a tumour suppressive function by downregulating ERCC3/XPB expression and serves as an independent prognostic factor in HCC patients.",

In subsequent studies, we found that KSR1 overexpression induced MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, demonstrating its causative role in activating the signaling pathway. This observation suggests that KSR1 overexpression serves as a major driver for the pathway activation in HCC which rarely harbors mutations in RAS and RAF. Although the precise molecular mechanism by which overexpression of KSR1 enhances MEK1/2 phosphorylation was not fully delineated in this study, previous reports indicate that KSR1 forms complexes with MEK and can allosterically transactivate BRAF, thereby enhancing its kinase activity toward MEK1/2 [34, 49] .

Interestingly, TSA treatment is able to increase the acetylation of histone H3 to increase the nuclear localization of KLF6 and its transcriptional activity [40] . These data indicate that HDACi treatment may enhance the histone H3 acetylation at the promoter region of KLF6 to promote its transcriptional activity. In our study, the expression of KLF6 is transcriptionally downregulated by CBX4. Combinative treatment of HDACi and CBX4 knockdown should be more powerful to reduce the ccRCC cell growth.

      "content": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and unlike other cancer types, incidence and mortality rates continue to rise. 1 In the UK, mortality rates have tripled in the last 50 years and are projected to increase further in the next two decades. 2 The vast majority of HCC cases occur on a background of chronic liver disease (CLD) and its sequela, cirrhosis. 3 The annual risk of HCC in patients with cirrhosis ranges from 2 to 6%. 3 The UK has the worst outcomes of hepatobiliary cancers amongst high-income countries. 4 Curative therapies for HCC, including resection or transplant, offer patients 5-year survival rates as high as 85%. 3, 5 However, less than 20% of patients receive curative therapies, with the large majority presenting with latestage malignancy or advanced liver disease precluding aggressive treatment. Late presentation of HCC is attributable to several factors, including a lack of regular cancer surveillance, and diagnostic and treatment delays. 6, 7 Late-stage HCC carries a dismal prognosis, with 5-year survival <20%. Additionally, late presentation is associated with poor quality of life and more frequent hospital admissions, leading to significant economic impact on the NHS. 8 The principle of targeted cancer surveillance is to repeatedly test asymptomatic individuals who are at risk of developing a disease, based on the premise that detection of cancer at an early stage allows the receipt of curative therapy improving survival outcomes. Ninety per cent of HCC cases arise on a background of chronic liver disease, thus there is an \"at risk\" population suitable for surveillance. The ideal surveillance test should be minimally invasive, affordable, acceptable to patients and with a high sensitivity and specificity. 9 The evidence base for HCC surveillance is drawn largely from a single randomised controlled trial in China, 10 assessing mortality in patients with hepatitis B. It demonstrated that 6-monthly ultrasound of the liver ± serum alphafetoprotein measurement reduced HCC-related mortality by 37%. Subsequent retrospective 11 and modelling studies [12] [13] [14] have concluded that HCC surveillance improves survival through early diagnosis and receipt of curative treatment. Consequently, biannual surveillance for HCC for patients with cirrhosis is recommended by all international professional bodies and NICE, 3 with compliance with biannual surveillance being associated with early diagnosis and improved survival outcomes. 15 There are notable criticisms of the current evidence base for surveillance. Concerns have been raised about whether the effect size seen in a group of largely non-cirrhotic hepatitis B carriers can be generalised to populations with established cirrhosis, who may be less likely to tolerate and benefit from any HCC treatment offered. 12 A reduction in risk of HCC-related mortality may be of limited real-world benefit in patients with advanced liver disease facing multiple competing causes of death a particular issue in patients with NAFLD where cardiovascular disease is key cause of the death. Further randomised controlled trials have been considered unfeasible or unethical, and novel data on surveillance benefits is largely drawn from modelling.",

Statin use is associated with a reduced risk of HCC development; however, the association between statin use and the prognosis of HCC after resection remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the effect of statin use on the prognosis after hepatic resection among patients with HCC.\nMethods A nationwide cohort study was performed with data from the National Health Insurance Service Database in Korea. Among 65,101 HCC patients who underwent hepatic resection between January 2002 and December 2017, we included 21,470 patients. For validation, a hospital-based cohort of 3366 patients with very early or early-stage HCC who received curative-intent hepatic resection between January 2010 and December 2018 was analyzed. Recurrencefree survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was compared between statin users and non-users. Findings Among the nationwide cohort of 21,470 patients, 2399 (11.2%) used statins and 19,071 (88.8%) did not. Among the hospital cohort of 3366 patients, 363 (10.8%) used statins and 3003 (89.2%) did not. In the propensity score-matched nationwide cohort, statin users had better RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.64; P < 0.001) and OS (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.45-0.53; P < 0.001), with a duration-response relationship. In the propensity score-matched validation hospital cohort, statin treatment was significantly associated with better RFS (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.90; P = 0.003) and OS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32-0.72; P < 0.001). The beneficial effects of statins were more prominent in non-cirrhotics, tumors sized ≥3 cm, tumors with microscopic vascular invasion, or early HCC recurrence (<2 years after resection).\nInterpretation Statin use was associated with a better prognosis in a population-based cohort of patients with HCC after hepatic resection, which was further validated in a large hospital-based cohort.\nFunding Asan Institute for Life Sciences and Corporate Relations; Korean Association for the Study of the Liver.",

Finally,  BMP7 expression was correlated with conventional clinicopathological features of  HCC and patient outcome. The expression of BMP7 mRNA and protein in HCC cells was  much higher than in normal hepatic cells.

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that a high-expression level of BMP7  resulted in a significantly poor prognosis of HCC patients. Multivariate analysis  revealed that BMP7 expression level was an independent prognostic parameter for  the overall survival rate of HCC patients.

It also provides a new mechanism by which CD5L slows down activation, through a combined action of enhancing SMAD7 activity and ID2 transcription factor levels. The role of SMAD7 as a negative feedback regulator of TGFβ in HSCs is well established. On the other hand, ID2 is a downstream target of BMP7 signalling, which has been proposed as a pivotal factor inhibiting TGFβ signalling and regulating hepatic fibrogenesis [9] . Therefore, it is possible that CD5L-mediated inhibition of TGFβ in HSCs occurs partially via the enhancement of the BMP7 signalling pathway.

      "content": "BACKGROUND: Liver fibrosis is a refractory disease whose persistence can  eventually induce cirrhosis or even liver cancer. Early liver fibrosis is  reversible by intervention. As a member of the transforming growth factor-beta  (TGF-beta) superfamily, bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) has anti-liver fibrosis  functions. However, little is known about BMP7 expression changes and its  potential regulatory mechanism as well as the relationship between BMP7 and TGF-beta  during liver fibrosis. In addition, the mechanism underlying the anti-liver  fibrosis function of BMP7 needs to be further explored. AIM: To investigate  changes in the dynamic expression of BMP7 during liver fibrosis, interactions  between BMP7 and TGF-beta1, and possible mechanisms underlying the anti-liver  fibrosis function of BMP7. METHODS: Changes in BMP7 expression during liver  fibrosis and the interaction between BMP7 and TGF-beta1 in mice were observed.  Exogenous BMP7 was used to treat mouse primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to  observe its effect on activation, migration, and proliferation of HSCs and  explore the possible mechanism underlying the anti-liver fibrosis function of  BMP7. Mice with liver fibrosis received exogenous BMP7 intervention to observe  improvement of liver fibrosis by using Masson's trichrome staining and detecting  the expression of the HSC activation indicator alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)  and the collagen formation associated protein type I collagen (Col I). Changes in  the dynamic expression of BMP7 during liver fibrosis in the human body were  further observed. RESULTS: In the process of liver fibrosis induced by carbon  tetrachloride (CCl(4)) in mice, BMP7 protein expression first increased, followed  by a decrease; there was a similar trend in the human body. This process was  accompanied by a sustained increase in TGF-beta1 protein expression. In vitro  experiment results showed that TGF-beta1 inhibited BMP7 expression in a time- and  dose-dependent manner. In contrast, high doses of exogenous BMP7 inhibited  TGF-beta1-induced activation, migration, and proliferation of HSCs; this inhibitory  effect was associated with upregulation of pSmad1/5/8 and downregulation of  phosphorylation of Smad3 and p38 by BMP7. In vivo experiment results showed that  exogenous BMP7 improved liver fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSION: During liver  fibrosis, BMP7 protein expression first increases and then decreases. This  changing trend is associated with inhibition of BMP7 expression by sustained  upregulation of TGF-beta1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Exogenous BMP7 could  selectively regulate TGF-beta/Smad pathway-associated factors to inhibit activation,  migration, and proliferation of HSCs and exert anti-liver fibrosis functions.  Exogenous BMP7 has the potential to be used as an anti-liver fibrosis drug.",

Therefore, it is essential to clarify the function and mechanism of TP53  mutations in HCC. Methods: We performed a sequence of bioinformatic analyses to  elucidate the characteristics of TP53 mutations in HCC. We downloaded the data of  hepatocellular carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and used different  R packages for serial analyses, including gene mutation analysis, copy number  variation analysis, analysis of the tumor mutational burden and microsatellite  instability, differential gene expression analysis, and functional enrichment  analysis of TP53 mutations, and performed gene set enrichment analysis. We  established a protein-protein interaction network using the STRING online  database and used the Cytoscape software for network visualization, and hub gene  screening. In addition, we performed anticancer drug sensitivity analysis using  data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer. Immune infiltration and  prognosis analyses were also performed. Results: Missense mutations accounted for  a great proportion of HCC mutations, the frequency of single nucleotide  polymorphisms was high, and C > T was the most common form of single nucleotide  variations. TP53 had a mutation rate of 30% and was the most commonly mutated  gene in HCC. In the TP53 mutant group, the tumor mutational burden (p < 0.001),  drug sensitivity (p < 0.05), ESTIMATE score (p = 0.038), and stromal score (p <  0.001) dramatically decreased. The Cytoscape software screened ten hub genes,  including CT45A1, XAGE1B, CT55, GAGE2A, PASD1, MAGEA4, CTAG2, MAGEA10, MAGEC1,  and SAGE1. The prognostic model showed a poor prognosis in the TP53 mutation  group compared with that in the wild-type group (overall survival, p = 0.023).  Univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses revealed that TP53 mutation  was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of HCC patients (p <0.05). The  constructed prognostic model had a favorable forecast value for the prognosis of  HCC patients at 1 and 3 years (1-year AUC = 0.752, 3-years AUC = 0.702).

Growing evidence supports MAGEA protein involvement in the regulation of the processes that underlie cancer cell survival, tumor formation, and metastasis [37, 38] . For instance, MAGEA4 inhibits the apoptosis of cancer cells by suppressing endogenousp53, or by enhancing malignant progression via p53-independent pathways [39] . Simultaneously, the overexpression of TWIST1, a bHLH transcription factor, may transcriptionally up-regulate the expression of MAGEA4 to activate cancer cell migration-invasion program [40] . In addition, MAGEA11 can activate androgen receptor signaling by forming a molecular bridge between transcriptionally active androgen receptor dimers to contribute to cancer cell growth [41] . Most recently, MAGEA11 was found to promote oncogenesis through interactions with retinoblastoma-related protein p107 and the E2F1 transcription factor, which is important for cell cycle progression and apoptosis [42] . Regarding the other 4 reported CTGs (KIF2C, CABYR, CAGE1 and PRAME), although previous studies have discovered that they may play a critical role in tumorigenesis [43] [44] [45] [46] , the potential molecular mechanisms, especially those in ESCC, are not yet well understood. More studies are warranted to further explore their functions in ESCC.",

Our findings demonstrate that KSR1 overexpression is a common feature in HCC and is significantly correlated with activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In subsequent studies, we found that KSR1 overexpression induced MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, demonstrating its causative role in activating the signaling pathway. This observation suggests that KSR1 overexpression serves as a major driver for the pathway activation in HCC which rarely harbors mutations in RAS and RAF. Although the precise molecular mechanism by which overexpression of KSR1 enhances MEK1/2 phosphorylation was not fully delineated in this study, previous reports indicate that KSR1 forms complexes with MEK and can allosterically transactivate BRAF, thereby enhancing its kinase activity toward MEK1/2 [34, 49] . Thus, it is plausible that KSR1 overexpression promotes MEK-KSR1 complex formation, leading to more efficient BRAFmediated phosphorylation of MEK1/2.",

In summary, the results provide potential biomarkers for the prediction of prognosis and present potential targets for the treatment of HCC patients.

      "content": "NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma is increasing in many geographical areas, together with the epidemic spread of metabolic syndrome worldwide. However, robust epidemiological data about prevalence and incidence of this problem are still unavailable, mainly because of the scarcity of population-based studies and the inability to identify NASH, which is the real predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with NAFLD. Although patients with NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma have typical clinical features of metabolic Review syndrome, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular comorbidities, older age, and obesity, no molecular features have been recognised. However, the steatohepatitic hepatocellular carcinoma variant has been identifi ed as a pathological feature of NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Because hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance is not standard care in NAFLD, many patients do not undergo screening, and hepatocellular carcinoma is thus often diagnosed in advanced stages, negatively aff ecting survival. Survival is also compromised by the association with metabolic syndrome, which restricts access to radical treatments including transplantation because of the increased surgical risk resulting from concurrent cardiovascular diseases. Although lifestyle modifi cations and some drugs, such as metformin and statins, have been suggested as potential strategies for primary prevention, the main goal is to improve secondary prevention by expanding access to hepatocellular carcinoma screening, a strategy that calls for better identifi cation of at-risk patients. Risk stratifi cation of patients with NAFLD should take into account simple demographic and clinical variables to make the process reproducible in non-expert centres. For example, a scoring system developed in Taiwan, which accounted for age, sex, medical history (including presence of diabetes), viral hepatitis status, aminotransferases, and α-fetoprotein, enabled identifi cation of almost all hepatocellular carcinoma cases by ultrasound in high-risk patients. 60 However, reproducing this experience in other geographical settings requires risk stratifi cation scores to be based on local disease epidemiology, whereas to have an impact on hepatocellular carcinoma burden, patient selection for targeted surveillance should be moved to the community to overcome the limitation of patient access by general practitioners or geographical barriers. Accordingly, raising awareness of the burden of NAFLD and implementation of screening pro grammes are the primary goals to be pursued by health authorities worldwide.",

      "content": "Firstly, by establishing two cell models with acquired ADR resistance, we screened the key components in Hippo signaling pathway and identified YAP1 as the major dysregulated molecule in ADR-R cells. The Hippo pathway, initially identified in Drosophila, has been shown to regulate organ size and tissue homeostasis in different model organisms [12, 14] . Moreover, accumulated studies have shown that dysregulated Hippo pathway is widely implicated in tumorigenesis, such as breast cancer [38] , colorectal cancer [14] , lung cancer [39] , and liver cancer [13] . Notably, liver specific genetic manipulation of multiple components of Hippo signaling pathway uniformly leads to liver enlargement and tumor development [40, 41] . As the well-characterized downstream transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway, YAP1 has been demonstrated to be highly activated in many human cancers. Upregulated YAP1 was frequently associated with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with cancer [40] . Meanwhile, YAP1 can promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, stemness and chemoresistance through multiple mechanisms [40] . Recently, several reports have uncovered the role of Hippo-YAP1-TEAD signaling pathway the chemoresistant phenotype of cancer cells. For example, phosphorylation-defective YAP1 makes ovarian cancer cells much more resistant to cisplatin and inhibition of YAP1 by siRNA increases sensitivity of erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cell line H1975 to erlotinib [42, 43] . In this study, we found that suppression of YAP1 resentisized ADR-R cells to ADR and introduction of consecutive active YAP1 enhanced HCC chemoresistance. The in vitro and in vivo growth rates of the ADR-R cells without ADR treatment were similar to their parental WT cells, indicating that the selection process did not alter the proliferation and tumorigenesis of these two sublines. Consistent with previous reports [44] , YAP1 indeed contributes to cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. However, the growthpromoting and anti-apoptotic effects of YAP1 were remarkably amplified in the presence of ADR treatment, suggesting its role in regulating HCC chemoresistance. Given other Hippo components were not altered in ADR-R cells, we postulated that YAP1 is activated by Hippo independent mechanisms. Secondly, we identified miR-590-5p as a modulator of YAP1 in ADR-R cells. Dysregulation of miR-590-5p have been documented in carcinogenesis and in the progression of several types of malignances [45] [46] [47] . In gastric cancer, miR-590-5p regulates gastric cancer chemosensitivity through RECK and the AKT/ERK pathway [47] . In cervical cancer, miR-590-5p acts as an oncogene by targeting the CHL1 gene and promotes cervical cancer proliferation [46] . In malignant melanoma, lncRNA-ATB functions as a competing endogenous RNA to promote YAP1 expression by sponging miR-590-5p [48] . In colorectal cancer, miR-590-5p suppresses tumorigenesis by targeting YAP1 [45] . In this study, Ou et al. showed that increased cell density led to elevated expression of RNase III endonuclease, DICER1, which increases miR-590 biogenesis and miR-590-5p expression; YAP1 is elevated in colorectal cancer tissues and associated with tumorigenesis; and miR-590-5p acts as a direct functional modulator of YAP1 in colorectal cancer [45] . Consistent with this report, we showed here that miR-590-5p directly targets YAP1 in HCC, and we revealed the regulatory of miR-590-5p/YAP1 axis in HCC chemoresistance from both in vitro and in vivo studies. Overexpression of miR-590-5p was sufficient to resentisize ADR-R cells to ADR treatment. Importantly, miR-590-5p may act as novel biomarker or predictor of radio-or chemo-responsiveness in several cancers [49] [50] [51] . Therefore, from both the therapeutic and diagnostic point of view, miR-590-5p is critically involved in the chemoresistant phenotype of cancers. MiR-590-5p acts as a density-sensitive microRNA in colorectal cancer [45] , however, we failed to found similar observation in HCC (data not shown), suggesting a tissue-specific manner of miR-590-5p regulation in cancers. In addition, we also determined the DNA copy number alteration, DNA methylation level, and expression of Dicer and Drosha in ADR-R cells and control cells. However, we did not get a positive result. Thus, the detailed reason for dysregulated miR-590-5p in HCC warrants further investigation. Thirdly, we correlated YAP1-mediated chemoresistance in HCC cells with increased expression of stemness markers and ABC transporters. A minority of cancer cells with stem-cell like properties can repopulate the tumor after anti-tumor drug treatment. ABC transporters can reduce the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapy drugs and are frequently increased following chemotherapy [32] . In ovarian cancer, YAP1/TEAD co-activator can regulate ovarian cancer initiated cell pluripotency and chemo-resistance by up-regulating stemness markers and ABC transporters [21] . Meanwhile, YAP activation can promote cancer stem cells self-renewal and chemoresistance in cancer cells [52] . Consistent with these observations, we certified that YAP1 was able to promote the expression of various stem-cell markers and ABC transporters in ADR-R cells. Given that ABC transporters remain attractive potential adjuvant to chemotherapy, our study provides an evidence for the development of potential targeted therapies focused on ABC transporters.",

However, little is known about the clinical value  of the coexpression patterns of multiple TAAs. METHODS: We determined the  expression of multiple TAAs with identified immunogenicity (GPC3, AFP, SSX-2,  NY-ESO-1, EpCAM, midkine) and the density of tumour-infiltrating immune cells by  immunohistochemistry in a panel of 362 primary HCC patients. We evaluated the  association between the TAAs, immune cell infiltration, clinicopathological  parameters, and prognosis. RESULTS: Patients who coexpressed more TAAs had better  prognosis (P<0.00001, overall survival). The integrated pattern of TAA was  associated with good differentiation and small tumour size, and with more CD57(+)  natural killer and CD20(+) B-cell infiltration (P<0.05). Multivariate Cox  proportional hazards analysis identified the TAA index as an independent  prognostic indicator (hazard ratio 0.625; 95% confidence interval 0.467-0.837;  P=0.002), and could further predict patient prognosis in collaboration with local  immune infiltration. CONCLUSION: Our results could provide new evidence for the  improvement of prognostic molecular signatures in HCC, and a novel rationale for  patient enrolment in future immunotherapeutic trials and/or clinical treatments.",

      "content": "Background: TP53 mutations are the most frequent mutations in hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC) and affect the occurrence and development of this cancer type.  Therefore, it is essential to clarify the function and mechanism of TP53  mutations in HCC. Methods: We performed a sequence of bioinformatic analyses to  elucidate the characteristics of TP53 mutations in HCC. We downloaded the data of  hepatocellular carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and used different  R packages for serial analyses, including gene mutation analysis, copy number  variation analysis, analysis of the tumor mutational burden and microsatellite  instability, differential gene expression analysis, and functional enrichment  analysis of TP53 mutations, and performed gene set enrichment analysis. We  established a protein-protein interaction network using the STRING online  database and used the Cytoscape software for network visualization, and hub gene  screening. In addition, we performed anticancer drug sensitivity analysis using  data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer. Immune infiltration and  prognosis analyses were also performed. Results: Missense mutations accounted for  a great proportion of HCC mutations, the frequency of single nucleotide  polymorphisms was high, and C > T was the most common form of single nucleotide  variations. TP53 had a mutation rate of 30% and was the most commonly mutated  gene in HCC. In the TP53 mutant group, the tumor mutational burden (p < 0.001),  drug sensitivity (p < 0.05), ESTIMATE score (p = 0.038), and stromal score (p <  0.001) dramatically decreased. The Cytoscape software screened ten hub genes,  including CT45A1, XAGE1B, CT55, GAGE2A, PASD1, MAGEA4, CTAG2, MAGEA10, MAGEC1,  and SAGE1. The prognostic model showed a poor prognosis in the TP53 mutation  group compared with that in the wild-type group (overall survival, p = 0.023).  Univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses revealed that TP53 mutation  was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of HCC patients (p <0.05). The  constructed prognostic model had a favorable forecast value for the prognosis of  HCC patients at 1 and 3 years (1-year AUC = 0.752, 3-years AUC = 0.702).  Conclusion: This study further deepened our understanding of TP53-mutated HCC,  provided new insights into a precise individualized therapy for HCC, and has  particular significance for prognosis prediction.",

MAGEA proteins are processed by the intracellular proteasome and their peptides are presented by the MHC class I molecules on the surface of cancer cells thereby making them ideal cancer specific antigens. Growing evidence supports MAGEA protein involvement in the regulation of the processes that underlie cancer cell survival, tumor formation, and metastasis [37, 38] . For instance, MAGEA4 inhibits the apoptosis of cancer cells by suppressing endogenousp53, or by enhancing malignant progression via p53-independent pathways [39] . Simultaneously, the overexpression of TWIST1, a bHLH transcription factor, may transcriptionally up-regulate the expression of MAGEA4 to activate cancer cell migration-invasion program [40] . In addition, MAGEA11 can activate androgen receptor signaling by forming a molecular bridge between transcriptionally active androgen receptor dimers to contribute to cancer cell growth [41] . Most recently, MAGEA11 was found to promote oncogenesis through interactions with retinoblastoma-related protein p107 and the E2F1 transcription factor, which is important for cell cycle progression and apoptosis [42] . Regarding the other 4 reported CTGs (KIF2C, CABYR, CAGE1 and PRAME), although previous studies have discovered that they may play a critical role in tumorigenesis [43] [44] [45] [46] , the potential molecular mechanisms, especially those in ESCC, are not yet well understood.

Immunological expression profiles [25] elucidated the enrichment of immunogenic HCC in the MS3 subtype, and the immune subclass of the MS3 (MS3i) had two hallmarks, better patient prognosis and increased immune cell infiltration, named as \"hot\". As previously reported, patients with \"hot\" tumors of the Immune class [25] and the C3 subtype [22] exhibited better survival. We most recently addressed that fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) was overexpressed in intratumoral hepatic stellate cells of metabolic disease-associated HCC, and that FABP4 contributed to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines through NF-κB nuclear translocation, resulting in the recruitment of macrophages [28] . M2 Macrophages are attractive targets for cancer treatment [35] , and pexidartinib, an inhibitor of the CSF1/CSF1-R signaling which plays essential roles in proliferation and differentiation of M2 macrophages, may improve the prognosis of patients with the MS3 subtype. Shalapour et al. have recently reported that the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling contributes to liver carcinogenesis in individuals with NASH [36] . These results are consistent with the immune profiles of the MS3 subtype (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4 ), and then imply that PD-1 blockade may inhibit the MS3 HCC growth and development. Since anti-CSF1R and anti-PD-1 antibodies can synergistically attenuate BRAF V600E -driven melanoma cells in mice [37] , the combination is also a promising therapy for the MS3 subtype.",

Statin use is associated with a reduced risk of HCC development; however, the association between statin use and the prognosis of HCC after resection remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the effect of statin use on the prognosis after hepatic resection among patients with HCC.\nMethods A nationwide cohort study was performed with data from the National Health Insurance Service Database in Korea. Among 65,101 HCC patients who underwent hepatic resection between January 2002 and December 2017, we included 21,470 patients. For validation, a hospital-based cohort of 3366 patients with very early or early-stage HCC who received curative-intent hepatic resection between January 2010 and December 2018 was analyzed. Recurrencefree survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was compared between statin users and non-users. Findings Among the nationwide cohort of 21,470 patients, 2399 (11.2%) used statins and 19,071 (88.8%) did not. Among the hospital cohort of 3366 patients, 363 (10.8%) used statins and 3003 (89.2%) did not. In the propensity score-matched nationwide cohort, statin users had better RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.64; P < 0.001) and OS (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.45-0.53; P < 0.001), with a duration-response relationship. In the propensity score-matched validation hospital cohort, statin treatment was significantly associated with better RFS (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.90; P = 0.003) and OS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32-0.72; P < 0.001). The beneficial effects of statins were more prominent in non-cirrhotics, tumors sized ≥3 cm, tumors with microscopic vascular invasion, or early HCC recurrence (<2 years after resection).\nInterpretation Statin use was associated with a better prognosis in a population-based cohort of patients with HCC after hepatic resection, which was further validated in a large hospital-based cohort.\nFunding Asan Institute for Life Sciences and Corporate Relations; Korean Association for the Study of the Liver.",

The  researchers employed various feature selection techniques to identify the key  predictors of patient mortality. Additionally, the study utilized a range of  machine learning methods to model patient survival rates. The study included 393  individuals with HCC. For early-stage patients (stages 1-2), the models reached  recall values ​​of up to 91% for 6-month survival prediction. For advanced-stage  patients (stage 4), the models achieved accuracy values ​​of up to 92% for 3-year  overall survival prediction. To predict whether patients are ex or not, the  accuracy was 87.5% when using all 28 features without feature selection with the  best performance coming from the implementation of weighted KNN. Further  improvements in accuracy, reaching 87.8%, were achieved by applying feature  selection methods and using a medium Gaussian SVM. This study demonstrates that  machine learning techniques can reliably predict survival probabilities for HCC  patients across all disease stages.

      "content": "Mounting evidence has shown that β-catenin acts as an intracellular signal transducer of the Wnt signaling pathway, and is involved in many physiological processes such as cell adhesion and cellular metabolism [41, 42] . In addition, aberrant activation of β-catenin by Wnt signals has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of liver cancer [43] . We have previously shown that overexpression of EZH2 stimulates β-catenin activity in HCC cells through the epigenetic inhibition of Wnt signal inhibitors [30] . Our present findings demonstrated that AR increased global H3K27me3 level after inducing EZH2 expression, suggesting the AR is an upstream regulator of EZH2-controlled epigenetic modification. Using promoter enrichment assay, we showed that the occupancy of EZH2 on the promoters of Wnt signal inhibitors, including AXIN2, NKD1, PPP2R2B, PRICKLE1 and SFRP5, were inhibited by knockdown of AR in PLC5 cells, whilst ectopic AR expression promoted the recruitment of EZH2 on these promoters in LO2 cells. Since the EZH2mediated H3K27me3 is responsible for transcriptional suppression, we also examined the change of H3K27me3 enrichment at the promoters of Wnt signal inhibitors. As expected, AR increased H3K27me3 enrichment at these promoters in HCC cells, which could be abolished by EZH2 knockdown. In accord, gene expression analysis showed that AR negatively regulated Wnt signal inhibitors mRNA levels through induction of EZH2 and H3K27me3 expression. This compelling evidence showed that AR activates β-catenin through EZH2-mediated epigenetic silencing of Wnt signal inhibitors. Gao et al. showed that EZH2 suppresses tumor suppressor TP53 in H3K27me3-independent manner in HCC, suggesting a putative non-epigenetic function of EZH2 on the regulation of target genes [44] . However, we did not have any data supporting such H3K27me3-independent non-epigenetic role of EZH2 in HCCs. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) binds with Wnt signal inhibitors to form a complex that degrades β-catenin through phosphorylation. When phosphorylated by oncogenic factors like CCRK, GSK3β dissociates from Wnt signal inhibitor complex, and hence β-catenin activity is restored [8] . These findings showed an alternative non-epigenetic mechanism for regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and further experiments are warranted to investigate the role of EZH2 in this process. CCND1 and EGFR are the two pro-proliferative downstream effectors of β-catenin signaling [45, 46] . In our study, their transcription was also found to be increased by AR overexpression, which was blocked by EZH2 knockdown. Furthermore, protein expression analysis consolidated that AR induced β-catenin activation and the expression of target genes CCND1 and EGFR, in which EZH2 is a critical mediator. Thus our findings suggest that AR/EZH2 epigenetic programming may play a key role in the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCCs.",

      "content": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of  cancer-related deaths worldwide, but there is a deficiency of early diagnosis  biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Drug resistance accounts for most HCC-related  deaths, yet the mechanisms underlying drug resistance remain poorly understood.  METHODS: Expression of Frizzled-10 (FZD10) in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) was  identified by means of RNA sequencing and validated by means of real-time  polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. In vitro and in vivo  experiments were used to assess the effect of FZD10 on liver CSC expansion and  lenvatinib resistance. RNA sequencing, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation,  and luciferase report assays were applied to explore the mechanism underlying  FZD10-mediated liver CSCs expansion and lenvatinib resistance. RESULTS:  Activation of FZD10 in liver CSCs was mediated by METTL3-dependent  N6-methyladenosine methylation of FZD10 messenger RNA. Functional studies  revealed that FZD10 promotes self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and metastasis of  liver CSCs via activating beta-catenin and YAP1. The FZD10-beta-catenin/YAP1 axis is  activated in liver CSCs and predicts poor prognosis. Moreover,  FZD10-beta-catenin/c-Jun axis transcriptionally activates METTL3 expression, forming  a positive feedback loop. Importantly, the FZD10/beta-catenin/c-Jun/MEK/ERK axis  determines the responses of hepatoma cells to lenvatinib treatment. Analysis of  patient cohort, patient-derived tumor organoids, and patient-derived xenografts  further suggest that FZD10 might predict lenvatinib clinical benefit in patients  with HCC. Furthermore, treatment of lenvatinib-resistant HCC with  adeno-associated virus targeting FZD10 or a beta-catenin inhibitor restored  lenvatinib response. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated FZD10 expression promotes expansion of  liver CSCs and lenvatinib resistance, indicating that FZD10 expression is a novel  prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for human HCC.",

Inhibition of CDC34 enhances anti-myeloma activity of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib [43] and contributes to the chemopreventive activity of Chinese herbs (anti-tumor B, ATB) in mouse model of lung cancer [59] . We showed that silencing of CDC34 inhibited cell proliferation and colony forming activity of NSCLC cells in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3 ), and suppressed tumor growth and prolonged lifespan of xenograft NSCLC mouse models in vivo (Fig. 4 ). In an EGFR L858R -driven mouse lung adenocarcinoma model, shCDC34 treatment significantly inhibited cancer progression and prolonged survival time of the mice (Fig. 8 ). These results indicate that CDC34 represents a rational drug target for NSCLC. Moreover, treatment of the patients with gefitinib and erlotinib will fail because of the development of EGFR T790M mutation [60] , which affects the gatekeeper residue in the kinase catalytic domain and weakens the interaction of the inhibitors with the target [61] . Efforts have been made to overcome drug resistance [62, 63] . Here, we showed that silencing of CDC34 dramatically suppressed tumor dissemination and cell proliferation in EGFR T790M/Del (exon 19)driven lung cancer (Fig. 8 ). Knockdown of CDC34 downregulated the expression of EGFR, pEGFR, pAKT, and pERK in EGFR T790M/Del (exon 19)  mice (Fig. 8 ). These data demonstrate that silencing of CDC34 can overcome T790M mutation-caused drug resistance, therefore represents an attrative therapeutic target in lung cancer.

Here, we identify  CD49f as a prominent marker for discerning TICs in hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC), outperforming other commonly used TIC markers. CD49f-high TICs  specifically recruit tumor-promoting neutrophils via the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis and  create an immunosuppressive milieu in the tumor microenvironment (TME).  Reciprocally, the neutrophils reprogram nearby tumor cells toward a TIC phenotype  via secreting CCL4. These cells can evade CD8(+) T cell-mediated killing through  CCL4/STAT3-induced and CD49f-stabilized CD155 expression. Notably, while aberrant  CD155 expression contributes to immune suppression, it also represents a  TIC-specific vulnerability. We demonstrate that either CD155 deletion or antibody  blockade significantly enhances sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy in preclinical  HCC models.

Late presentation of HCC is attributable to several factors, including a lack of regular cancer surveillance, and diagnostic and treatment delays. 6, 7 Late-stage HCC carries a dismal prognosis, with 5-year survival <20%. Additionally, late presentation is associated with poor quality of life and more frequent hospital admissions, leading to significant economic impact on the NHS. 8 The principle of targeted cancer surveillance is to repeatedly test asymptomatic individuals who are at risk of developing a disease, based on the premise that detection of cancer at an early stage allows the receipt of curative therapy improving survival outcomes. Ninety per cent of HCC cases arise on a background of chronic liver disease, thus there is an \"at risk\" population suitable for surveillance. The ideal surveillance test should be minimally invasive, affordable, acceptable to patients and with a high sensitivity and specificity. 9 The evidence base for HCC surveillance is drawn largely from a single randomised controlled trial in China, 10 assessing mortality in patients with hepatitis B. It demonstrated that 6-monthly ultrasound of the liver ± serum alphafetoprotein measurement reduced HCC-related mortality by 37%. Subsequent retrospective 11 and modelling studies [12] [13] [14] have concluded that HCC surveillance improves survival through early diagnosis and receipt of curative treatment. Consequently, biannual surveillance for HCC for patients with cirrhosis is recommended by all international professional bodies and NICE, 3 with compliance with biannual surveillance being associated with early diagnosis and improved survival outcomes. 15 There are notable criticisms of the current evidence base for surveillance. Concerns have been raised about whether the effect size seen in a group of largely non-cirrhotic hepatitis B carriers can be generalised to populations with established cirrhosis, who may be less likely to tolerate and benefit from any HCC treatment offered. 12 A reduction in risk of HCC-related mortality may be of limited real-world benefit in patients with advanced liver disease facing multiple competing causes of death a particular issue in patients with NAFLD where cardiovascular disease is key cause of the death. Further randomised controlled trials have been considered unfeasible or unethical, and novel data on surveillance benefits is largely drawn from modelling.",

As previously reported, patients with \"hot\" tumors of the Immune class [25] and the C3 subtype [22] exhibited better survival. We most recently addressed that fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) was overexpressed in intratumoral hepatic stellate cells of metabolic disease-associated HCC, and that FABP4 contributed to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines through NF-κB nuclear translocation, resulting in the recruitment of macrophages [28] . M2 Macrophages are attractive targets for cancer treatment [35] , and pexidartinib, an inhibitor of the CSF1/CSF1-R signaling which plays essential roles in proliferation and differentiation of M2 macrophages, may improve the prognosis of patients with the MS3 subtype. Shalapour et al. have recently reported that the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling contributes to liver carcinogenesis in individuals with NASH [36] . These results are consistent with the immune profiles of the MS3 subtype (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4 ), and then imply that PD-1 blockade may inhibit the MS3 HCC growth and development.

RESULTS: Severe  alterations were found in the expression of different Kallikrein genes across  various cancers. Interestingly, renal clear cell and papillary carcinomas have  similar kallikrein expression profiles, whereas, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma  has a unique expression profile. Several KLK genes have excellent biomarker  potential (AUC > 0.90) for chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (KLK2, KLK3, KLK4,  KLK7, KLK15), renal papillary carcinoma (KLK1, KLK6, KLK7), clear cell renal cell  carcinoma (KLK1, KLK6), thyroid carcinoma (KLK2, KLK4, KLK13, KLK15) and colon  adenocarcinoma (KLK6, KLK7, KLK8, KLK10). Several KLK genes were significantly  associated with mortality in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (KLK2: HR = 1.69;  KLK4: HR = 1.63; KLK8: HR = 1.71; KLK10: HR = 2.12; KLK11: HR = 1.76; KLK14: HR =  1.86), papillary renal cell carcinoma (KLK6: HR = 3.38, KLK7: HR = 2.50),  urothelial bladder carcinoma (KLK5: HR = 1.89, KLK6: HR = 1.71, KLK8: HR = 1.60),  and hepatocellular carcinoma (KLK13: HR = 1.75). METHODS: The RNA-seq gene  expression data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Statistical  analyses, including differential expression analysis, receiver operating  characteristic curves and survival analysis (Cox proportional-hazards regression  models) were performed. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive analysis revealed the  changes in the expression of different KLK genes associated with specific cancers  and highlighted their potential as a diagnostic and prognostic tool.",

Our findings demonstrate that KSR1 overexpression is a common feature in HCC and is significantly correlated with activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In subsequent studies, we found that KSR1 overexpression induced MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, demonstrating its causative role in activating the signaling pathway. This observation suggests that KSR1 overexpression serves as a major driver for the pathway activation in HCC which rarely harbors mutations in RAS and RAF. Although the precise molecular mechanism by which overexpression of KSR1 enhances MEK1/2 phosphorylation was not fully delineated in this study, previous reports indicate that KSR1 forms complexes with MEK and can allosterically transactivate BRAF, thereby enhancing its kinase activity toward MEK1/2 [34, 49] . Thus, it is plausible that KSR1 overexpression promotes MEK-KSR1 complex formation, leading to more efficient BRAFmediated phosphorylation of MEK1/2.",

PRAS40 (encoded by AKT1S1) phosphorylation was increased in human melanoma, prostate cancer and lung cancer specimens, which was considered as the results of Akt activation. However the mechanism in detail and its role in HCC stay elusive. Methods: PRAS40 expression and phosphorylation were analyzed in HCC specimens, and the survival rates of patients were investigated. Functional analyses of PRAS40 in HCC were performed in vivo and in vitro. The miR-124-3p binding sites in PRAS40 were investigated using luciferase assay. MiR-124-3p expression in HCC specimens was examined by In Situ hybridization, and the correlation to PRAS40 level was evaluated. Findings: The phosphorylation, protein and mRNA levels of PRAS40 were increased significantly in HCC specimens from our cohorts and TCGA database, which was positively correlated to the poor prognosis of HCC patients. Compared to Akt1s1 +/+ mice, hepatocarcinogenesis was suppressed in Akt1s1 À/À mice, and the activation of Akt was impaired. PRAS40 depletion resulted in the inhibition of HCC cellular proliferation. Tumor suppressor miR-124-3p was found to downregulate PRAS40 expression by targeting its 3 0 UTR. MiR-124-3p levels were inversely correlated to PRAS40 protein and phosphorylation levels in HCC specimens. The proliferation inhibition by miR-124-3p mimics was partially reversed by exogenous PRAS40 introduction in HCC cells. Interpretation: PRAS40 hyperexpression induced by loss of miR-124-3p contributes to PRAS40 hyperphosphorylation and hepatocarcinogenesis. These results could be expected to offer novel clues for understanding hepatocarcinogenesis and developing approaches.",

      "content": "As well known, TGF-b/SMAD signaling is a canonical pathway responsible for activating HSCs and transdifferentiating them into myofibroblasts; 28 specific blockade of TGF-b1 signaling has been demonstrated to induce the remission of liver fibrosis in various animal models. 29 Our present study found specific inhibition of HSC THBS2 deactivates TGF-b1-SMAD2/3 signaling in vivo and in vitro; vice versa, THBS2 peptide treatment activates this profibrotic signaling in HSCs, suggesting THBS2 may act as an upstream regulator of TGF-b1-SMAD2/3 signaling. The specificity of the effect of THBS2 on TGF-b signaling activation was validated through THBS2 peptide stimulation, in a dose-or timedependent manner, as well as with the TGF-b signaling inhibitor LY 2157299. Nan et al. recently reported that TGF-b1 and THBS2 also constitute a complex feedback circuit activating mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling in reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, indicating TGF-b signaling may also stimulate THBS2 expression. 8 In HSCs, the crosstalk between THBS2 and TGF-b signaling may enhance cell activation and lead to the production of various inflammatory molecules or activation of Kupffer cells in a paracrine manner, which to some extent explains the prominent inhibition of intrahepatic inflammatory infiltration after HSC Thbs2 knockdown in vivo. Apart from TGF-b signaling, our recent studies have highlighted that FAK signaling is one of the specific pathways involved in liver fibrosis regardless of etiology. 12, 30 Also, FAK has been experimentally confirmed to play an essential role in HSC activation and liver fibrosis progression. 31 Interestingly, THBS2 has been predicted to be involved in FAK signaling in previous studies. 12, 32 Our present study experimentally demonstrates that the perturbation of THBS2 expression also specifically modulates downstream FAK signaling and HSC activity in vivo and in vitro. 12 Next, IPA software (QIAGEN, CA, USA) analysis, together with previous studies, show LRP1, 33 NOTCH3, 33 VLDLR, CACNA2D1, 34 TLR4 24 and integrin avb3/CD36 8 are specific cell receptors for the THBS2 ligand. Among these receptors, TLR4 has been linked to downstream TGF-b/FAK signaling. 25, 26 In addition, TLR4 is highly localized on HSCs and dynamically upregulated during liver fibrosis progression, while its inhibition has been shown to prevent TGF-b/FAK signaling and subsequent HSC activation. An early study shows TLR4 activation in HSCs sensitizes them to TGF-b signals and thus allows for unrestricted activation by Kupffer cells in liver fibrosis. 25 In cancer cells, THBS2 has been found to interact with TLR4 but not with other toll-like receptors. 24 Given this, we tried to verify whether TLR4 is a specific receptor for secreted THBS2 in HSCs. Our present study, using immunofluorescent co-localization, co-immunoprecipitation coupled with far-western blotting, has confirmed that THBS2 directly binds to TLR4 on the membrane of HSCs. Moreover, liver TLR4 expression is positively associated with THBS2 and is diminished along with specifically targeting Thbs2 in HSCs in vivo. The functional roles of THBS2-TLR4 crosstalk on downstream TGF-b/FAK signaling and HSC activation were validated using THBS2 peptide, THBS2 plasmid, and/or a TLR4-specific inhibitor in HSCs. More interestingly, extracellular THBS2 acts on TLR4 as a dimer form, as the molecular weight of THBS2 located in the ECM is nearly two-fold higher than that of intracellular THBS2. However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in the formation of THBS2 dimers and whether obstruction of such dimer formation will relieve liver fibrosis are worthy of investigation.",

The incidence of HCC is increasing, whereas the treatment options are limited and often inefficient [1] . The poor understanding of the molecular mechanism of HCC carcinogenesis and progression is considered as the main obstruction. PRAS40 (encoded by AKT1S1) was primarily found as a 14-3-3 binding protein [2] , characterized as a substrate for Akt [3] and a component of mTOR complex 1 [3À7]. PRAS40 plays an essential role in cell survival, proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, senescence, immunoregulation and protein degradation in different species [3,8À10] . Hyperphosphorylation of PRAS40 has been reported in human melanoma, prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer [10À12]. However, it remains elusive whether the hyperphosphorylation of PRAS40 is caused only by the activation of the upstream Akt pathway, or is the result of its own hyperexpression. PRAS40 knockdown suppresses the cellular proliferation by deregulating apoptosis [9, 10] , which might be associated with p53 upregulation in a Ribosomal protein 11-dependent manner [13] . In addition, PRAS40 is phosphorylated by Rab11-family interacting protein 4, mediating the migration and invasion of HCC cells [14] . However, it needs to be clarified whether the expression level of PRAS40 associates with HCC progression.",

      "content": "Regarding the underlying mechanisms, CDCA5 was identified as an evolutionarily conserved small molecular protein that contributes to maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion from the S phase to the onset of anaphase [57] . It has been reported that high levels of CDCA5 expression promoted lung cancer cells proliferation interaction with ERK kinase through the activation of the MAPK pathway [31] . In another study, the upregulation of CDCA5 was confirmed to increase cell viability and proliferation in gastric cancer malignant progression via influencing cyclin E1 [58] . However, the tumorigenic functions of CDCA5 in ESCC have remained largely unclear thus far. The present study found that the knockdown of CDCA5 strongly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells. Consistently, the overexpression of CDCA5 promoted ESCC cells proliferation, invasion and migration. What's more, CDCA5 knockdown enhanced the chemosensitivity of ESCC cells to cisplatin and led to a significant reduction in the tumor volumes and weights of mice tumors. All of these findings suggested that CDCA5 might serve as a potential immunotherapeutic target for ESCC intervention. Recent evidence indicates that the regulation of the cell cycle is extremely important to the cell because a dysregulated cell cycle leads the cell to grow autonomously, which is thought to be a fundamental hallmark of cancer, especially the checkpoint pathways [30, 59] . In this study, we present the first evidence that CDCA5 knockdown induced G2/M phases arrest and apoptosis in ESCC. The results support the putative role of CDCA5 in chromatid separation during the G2/M transition [60] . Notably, the GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the term \"cell cycle\" ranks first among CDCA5-related potential pathways. Moreover, the key members of cell cycle pathway (CCNA2, CCNB1, CDC25A and PCNA) showed significant co-expression with CDCA5. Consistent with this finding, in vitro experiments revealed that inhibition of CDCA5 significantly suppressed the expression of CCNA2, CCNB1, CDC25A and PCNA, and these genes appear to function with cell cycle pathway to govern ESCC development. Regarding the regulation of CDCA5, we found that the CDCA5 promoter was highly acetylated in ESCC cells. Highlighting the finding, we speculated that the acetylation modification of the CDCA5 promoter might be the potential activation mechanism of CDCA5 in ESCC. Further functional assays are warranted to support our speculation.",

Methods: Based on the  information of Oncomine Cancer GeneChip database, we analyzed the correlation  between the expression level of LDLR and the expression level of carcinoembryonic  antigen (CEA) and CD31 in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Lentiviral  transfection of short hairpin RNA target genes was used to construct  LDLR-knockdown MHCC-97H and HLE hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The differential  genes and their expression level changes in LDLR-knockdown hepatocellular  carcinoma cells were detected by transcriptome sequencing, real-time fluorescence  quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and protein immunoblotting. The  gene-related signaling pathways that involve LDLR were clarified by enrichment  analysis. The effect of LDLR on CEA was assessed by the detection of CEA content  in conditioned medium of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Angiogenesis assay was  used to detect the effect of LDLR on the angiogenic capacity of human umbilical  vein endothelial cells, as well as the role of CEA in the regulation of  angiogenesis by LDLR. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the  expression levels of LDLR in 176 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, and CEA and  CD31 in 146 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, and analyze the correlations  between the expression levels of LDLR, CEA, and CD31 in the tissues, serum CEA,  and alanine transaminase (ALT). Results: Oncomine database analysis showed that  the expressions of LDLR and CEA in the tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma  patients with portal vein metastasis were negatively correlated (r=-0.64,  P=0.001), whereas the expressions of CEA and CD31 in these tissues were  positively correlated ( r=0.46, P=0.010). The transcriptome sequencing results  showed that there were a total of 1 032 differentially expressed genes in the  LDLR-knockdown group and the control group of MHCC-97H cells, of which 517 genes  were up-regulated and 515 genes were down-regulated. The transcript expression  level of CEACAM5 was significantly up-regulated in the cells of the  LDLR-knockdown group. The Gene Ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis showed  that the differential genes were most obviously enriched in the angiogenesis  function. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway  enrichment analysis showed that the relevant pathways involved mainly included  the cellular adhesion patch, the extracellular matrix receptor interactions, and  the interactions with the extracellular matrix receptors. The CEA content in the  conditioned medium of the LDLR-knockdown group was 43.75+/-8.43, which was higher  than that of the control group (1.15+/-0.14, P＜0.001). The results of angiogenesis  experiments showed that at 5 h, the number of main junctions, the number of main  segments, and the total area of the lattice formed by HUVEC cells cultured with  the conditioned medium of MHCC-97H cells in the LDLR-knockdown group were  295.3+/-26.4, 552.5+/-63.8, and 2 239 781.0+/-13 8211.9 square pixels, which were  higher than those of the control group (113.3+/-23.5, 194.8+/-36.5, and 660 621.0+/-280  328.3 square pixels, respectively, all P＜0.01).The number of vascular major  junctions, the number of major segments, and the total area of the lattice formed  by HUVEC cells cultured in conditioned medium with HLE cells in the  LDLR-knockdown group were 245.3+/-42.4, 257.5+/-20.4, and 2 535 754.5+/-249 094.2  square pixels, respectively, which were all higher than those of the control  group (113.3+/-23.5, 114.3+/-12.2, and 1 565 456.5+/-219 259.7 square pixels,  respectively, all P＜0.01). In the conditioned medium for the control group of  MHCC-97H cells,the number of main junctions, the number of main segments, and the  total area of the lattice formed by the addition of CEA to cultured HUVEC cells  were 178.9+/-12.0, 286.9+/-12.3, and 1 966 990.0+/-126 249.5 spixels, which were higher  than those in the control group (119.7+/-22.1, 202.7+/-33.7, and 1 421 191.0+/-189  837.8 square pixels, respectively). The expression of LDLR in hepatocellular  carcinoma tissues was not correlated with the expression of CEA, but was  negatively correlated with the expression of CD31 (r=-0.167, P=0.044), the level  of serum CEA (r=-0.061, P=0.032), and the level of serum ALT(r=-0.147,P=0.05).  The expression of CEA in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was positively  correlated with the expression of CD31 (r=0.192, P=0.020). The level of serum CEA  was positively correlated with the level of serum ALT (r=0.164, P=0.029).  Conclusion: Knocking down LDLR can promote vascular abnormalities in HCC by  releasing CEA.",

Although sorafenib, an orally administered multikinase inhibitor, has produced survival benefits for patients with advanced HCC, favorable clinical outcomes are limited due to individual differences and resistance. Immunotherapy is a promising approach, and its application to HCC is urgently needed. Infiltration of macrophages, mediated by the CCL2/CCR2 axis, is a potential immunotherapeutic target for HCC. Here, we report that a natural product from Abies georgei, named 747 and related in structure to kaempferol, exhibits sensitivity and selectivity as a CCR2 antagonist. The specificity of 747 on CCR2 was demonstrated via calcium flux, the binding domain of CCR2 was identified in an extracellular loop by chimeras binding assay, and in vivo antagonistic activity of 747 was confirmed with a TG-induced peritonitis model. In vivo, 747 elevated the number of CD8+ T cells in tumors via blocking tumor-infiltrating macrophage-mediated immunosuppression and inhibited orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor growth in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Further, 747, without obvious toxicity, enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of low-dose sorafenib through elevating intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells and increasing death of tumor cells. Thus, we have discovered a natural CCR2 antagonist, 747, and have provided a new perspective on development of CCR2 antagonists for treatment of related diseases. In mouse models of HCC, 747 improves the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and potentiates the therapeutic effect of sorafenib, indicating that the combination of immunomodulators and chemotherapeutic drugs could be a new approach for treating HCC.",

Higher HDAC2 levels are correlated with poor survival of HCC patients (Ler et al., 2015; Quint et al., 2011) , which is consistent with results of the current study. In HCC cells, inhibiting of HDAC2 disrupts the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and leads to apoptosis through upregulating the total p21, p27, and acetylated p53 levels and reducing CDK6 and BCL2 levels (Lee et al., 2014; Noh et al., 2011) ; these results suggest that HDAC2 could be a therapeutic target for HCC.

In addition to these agents, N20 different HDACis have produced encouraging results for the treatment of hematological malignancies, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and acute myelocytic leukemia; however, the therapeutic effects of HDACis on solid tumors have been disappointing (West and Johnstone, 2014) . In addition to toxicity, the off-target actions of the HDACis may lead to treatment failure for solid tumors. Thus, inhibitors that are selective for HDAC2 should be developed, and their therapeutic effects in HCC patients need to be addressed.",

The  researchers employed various feature selection techniques to identify the key  predictors of patient mortality. Additionally, the study utilized a range of  machine learning methods to model patient survival rates. The study included 393  individuals with HCC. For early-stage patients (stages 1-2), the models reached  recall values ​​of up to 91% for 6-month survival prediction. For advanced-stage  patients (stage 4), the models achieved accuracy values ​​of up to 92% for 3-year  overall survival prediction. To predict whether patients are ex or not, the  accuracy was 87.5% when using all 28 features without feature selection with the  best performance coming from the implementation of weighted KNN. Further  improvements in accuracy, reaching 87.8%, were achieved by applying feature  selection methods and using a medium Gaussian SVM.

By comparing a typically extracellular Gln-reliant to a well-differentiated cell, we have unravelled extensive and severe metabolic perturbations that occur mainly in the poorly differentiated cells.

      "content": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of  cancer-related deaths worldwide, but there is a deficiency of early diagnosis  biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Drug resistance accounts for most HCC-related  deaths, yet the mechanisms underlying drug resistance remain poorly understood.  METHODS: Expression of Frizzled-10 (FZD10) in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) was  identified by means of RNA sequencing and validated by means of real-time  polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. In vitro and in vivo  experiments were used to assess the effect of FZD10 on liver CSC expansion and  lenvatinib resistance. RNA sequencing, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation,  and luciferase report assays were applied to explore the mechanism underlying  FZD10-mediated liver CSCs expansion and lenvatinib resistance. RESULTS:  Activation of FZD10 in liver CSCs was mediated by METTL3-dependent  N6-methyladenosine methylation of FZD10 messenger RNA. Functional studies  revealed that FZD10 promotes self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and metastasis of  liver CSCs via activating beta-catenin and YAP1. The FZD10-beta-catenin/YAP1 axis is  activated in liver CSCs and predicts poor prognosis. Moreover,  FZD10-beta-catenin/c-Jun axis transcriptionally activates METTL3 expression, forming  a positive feedback loop. Importantly, the FZD10/beta-catenin/c-Jun/MEK/ERK axis  determines the responses of hepatoma cells to lenvatinib treatment. Analysis of  patient cohort, patient-derived tumor organoids, and patient-derived xenografts  further suggest that FZD10 might predict lenvatinib clinical benefit in patients  with HCC. Furthermore, treatment of lenvatinib-resistant HCC with  adeno-associated virus targeting FZD10 or a beta-catenin inhibitor restored  lenvatinib response. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated FZD10 expression promotes expansion of  liver CSCs and lenvatinib resistance, indicating that FZD10 expression is a novel  prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for human HCC.",

      "content": "CDC34 exerts oncogenic or tumor-promoting functions, and has been used as a therpeutic target for drug development [58] . Inhibition of CDC34 enhances anti-myeloma activity of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib [43] and contributes to the chemopreventive activity of Chinese herbs (anti-tumor B, ATB) in mouse model of lung cancer [59] . We showed that silencing of CDC34 inhibited cell proliferation and colony forming activity of NSCLC cells in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3 ), and suppressed tumor growth and prolonged lifespan of xenograft NSCLC mouse models in vivo (Fig. 4 ). In an EGFR L858R -driven mouse lung adenocarcinoma model, shCDC34 treatment significantly inhibited cancer progression and prolonged survival time of the mice (Fig. 8 ). These results indicate that CDC34 represents a rational drug target for NSCLC. Moreover, treatment of the patients with gefitinib and erlotinib will fail because of the development of EGFR T790M mutation [60] , which affects the gatekeeper residue in the kinase catalytic domain and weakens the interaction of the inhibitors with the target [61] . Efforts have been made to overcome drug resistance [62, 63] . Here, we showed that silencing of CDC34 dramatically suppressed tumor dissemination and cell proliferation in EGFR T790M/Del (exon 19)driven lung cancer (Fig. 8 ). Knockdown of CDC34 downregulated the expression of EGFR, pEGFR, pAKT, and pERK in EGFR T790M/Del (exon 19)  mice (Fig. 8 ). These data demonstrate that silencing of CDC34 can overcome T790M mutation-caused drug resistance, therefore represents an attrative therapeutic target in lung cancer. Preclinical and clinical studies of using CDC34 inhibitor to treat lung cancer with or without EGFR mutation warrant intensive investigation.",

      "content": "In conclusion, we evaluated the prognostic capacity of 30 gene signatures and found that 11 were significantly associated with the OS of HCC patients in two HCC cohorts. The genes from the 11 signatures consisted of a scale-free functional PPI network. The protein expression levels of the core nodes, RAD21, CDK1, and HDAC2, had prognostic value for HCC patients; however, only CDK1 was an independent prognostic factor. Further, because inhibition of CDK1 showed promising anticancer activity, it could serve as a therapeutic target for HCCs. In summary, the results provide potential biomarkers for the prediction of prognosis and present potential targets for the treatment of HCC patients. However, more studies are warranted to determine the roles of these proteins and to develop novel therapeutics for HCC.",

      "content": "Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) possess the ability to evade anti-tumor immunity,  potentially explaining many failures of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we identify  CD49f as a prominent marker for discerning TICs in hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC), outperforming other commonly used TIC markers. CD49f-high TICs  specifically recruit tumor-promoting neutrophils via the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis and  create an immunosuppressive milieu in the tumor microenvironment (TME).  Reciprocally, the neutrophils reprogram nearby tumor cells toward a TIC phenotype  via secreting CCL4. These cells can evade CD8(+) T cell-mediated killing through  CCL4/STAT3-induced and CD49f-stabilized CD155 expression. Notably, while aberrant  CD155 expression contributes to immune suppression, it also represents a  TIC-specific vulnerability. We demonstrate that either CD155 deletion or antibody  blockade significantly enhances sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy in preclinical  HCC models. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of tumor immune evasion and  provide a rationale for combining CD155 blockade with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in  HCC.",
